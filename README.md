# Flix

**Flix** is an innovative online rental platform that allows users to rent movies and TV shows available on various streaming services. This project was created out of the need to maximize the value of our streaming subscriptions by allowing you to rent only the content you want to watch, without the need for multiple subscriptions.

## Features

- **Smart Search**: Find any movie or TV show available on major streaming platforms.
- **Simplified Rental**: Rent only what you want to watch, without committing to long-term subscriptions.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Receive suggestions based on your rental history and preferences.
- **Rental Management**: Track your rentals, due dates, and rental history.

## How It Works

Flix integrates with different streaming platforms to provide a centralized catalog. When you locate a movie or TV show, you can rent it directly through our site, accessing the content without leaving the platform. This approach saves you time and money, ensuring you make the most of what each service has to offer.

## Why Flix?

With Flix, we eliminate the need for multiple subscriptions and offer a practical, cost-effective way to access the content you really want to see. No more paying for services you don't useâ€” with Flix, you only rent what you need, when you need it.
